# Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm: finds the majority element of a sequence
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1) assume count(majority) > length / 2
# If majority less than half, sort and count within O(n log n) time O(1) space
# Or use sampling algorithms

# The majority numbers are united: they add to the count of their peers
# Other numbers tries to subtract majority numbers' count to zero
# Other numbers could fight amongst themselves, subtracting each other's count
# Even all other numbers get united to take on the big one, they are 1 short
